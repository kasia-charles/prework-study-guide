# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation in creating the Prework Study Guide Webpage was to have a designated place to refer to and add important notes on each topic we learn throughout the course of the coding bootcamp. I built this project in order to make the course material easy to reference and practice throughout my time in the coding bootcamp. It solves the problem of having my notes all in one place, that is well organized and easy to search for any information I may be needing to reference in the future. I learned about Github, CSS, JavaScript, and README files prior to the coding bootcamp starting.
